# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian knowledge management vault focused on business planning and project management, particularly for the Athena Blue blue carbon marketplace initiative. The repository uses the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) for organization.

## Directory Structure

The vault follows PARA methodology with duplicate naming patterns:
- `01 Projects/` and `1. Projects/` - Active projects and initiatives
- `02 Areas/` and `2. Areas/` - Areas of responsibility
- `03 Resources/` and `3. Resources/` - Reference materials
- `4. Archives/` and `99 Archives/` - Archived content
- `Project/` - Additional project files (Athena Blue business plan)
- `.obsidian/` - Obsidian configuration and plugins

## Key Files

- `Work Plan.md` - Active task list and priorities
- `Project/Athena Blue/Biz plan/` - Comprehensive business planning documents for the Athena Blue blue carbon marketplace
- `01 Projects/Athena Blue/Strategy/athena-blue-strategic-recommendations.md` - Detailed strategic playbook with roadmaps, KPIs, and implementation plans

## Metadata Format

Files use YAML frontmatter for PARA categorization:
```yaml
---
para: "Projects" 
status: "active"
owner: "self"
area: "Business Development"
---
```

## Working with Content

- This is a knowledge management vault, not a code repository
- Files are primarily Markdown documents with business planning content
- `.base` files contain Obsidian Dataview queries for dynamic content

- Strategic recommendations and implementation roadmaps

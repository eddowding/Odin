Speaker 1
And indeed there's a a a fine balancing act to be had, right? 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Um although they're not completely disconnected. Like conceptually, it's actually quite similar, but in terms of execution, very, very different. I just want to make that caveat. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Because our paths will probably may may cross in the future and it's just good to to know that in terms of like my my boss might be in the same room as your boss I was wondering whether yeah, okay, fine, fine, fine. 

Speaker 3
So you're making that from a sort of defensive that point for us sort of defensive just in case this let's not let this pollute if it if it yeah you know just in case it's not that 

Speaker 1
I try to build a bit of a firewall between this and my day work. It's a slightly porous firewall, but one that I try and main some awareness of and other people that I'm talking to who are in this kind of similar space. Um, but it's not a big deal, so it's nothing to feel anxious about if if it pops up in in that situation. Um, but yeah, so You know, I don't know about you, but I find this work quite horrific. worse than what you any kind of climate conscious person would probably even imagine from the outside. You know, you know, we the the money that gets spent to put on a two hour event at New York Climate Week or something like that is just mind boggling compared to, you know, it's you know equivalent to an annual s an annual salary of somebody at Green Alliance or something like that, gets gone in two hours. I'm an old leftist, like historically, although I don't find that particularly useful phrase anymore. So it's a kind of a strange tension. I also perceive myself, well while my contemporary life doesn't really show it, but I perceive myself as a working class person and the climate space, as you know, is eye-wateringly privileged. So for several years now, I've kind of been talking about climate populism and failed miserably at getting any traction Even friends didn't want to talk about it because they were too triggered by the word populism and that's being inherently progressive and even far-right. That shifted quite significantly around the second Trump win, at which point I started thinking, okay, the work that I'm doing right now in my day job is just not good enough? Do I try and get you know, do I could try and become a CSO at some really obscure company which I could probably just about pull off? and try and get some impact that way? Or do I try and actually really go all in on climate populism and kind of burn my bridges with the That world of corporate stuff, and I decided to kind of go for the latter. So I started talking more, embodying populism more, which is actually quite easy for me because it's kind of like my natural state. And so I started writing about it a little bit. Then other people started writing about climate populism. Rupert Reed and Caroline Lucas did their article, which I thought was rubbish. and wrote a kind of r a response article to that outlining why I felt it was rubbish. And it started Distinguishing between kind of my take on clubber populism and other takes that were starting to emerge. Since then, Zach's come up with his take, which is also rubbish, from with the leadership party bid. Zach Goldsmith. Zach Polanski, who's trying to become the leader of the Green Party right now, he's got an eco-populism platform which is performative and limp. So, but then I'm, you know, it's all still stuck in the same progressive theory of change. Talk about stuff, assume something changes as a result of people being in receipt of information, which we know fails. So that's where it's like, okay, nice idea, starting to get a little bit of traction. How do we translate that abstract conversation around climate populism that is an internal discussion amongst climate progressives? Into a real life phenomenon that actually has traction with the type of people that we're talking about, i. e. , day email readers, reform voters, GB news viewers. And that's where our Fair Future started to come into life. So obviously, the word climate is not in it, the word populism is not in it. See that I see as an abstract, almost academic discussion. 

Speaker 2
Our fair future is the deployment. 

Speaker 1
So it's got a different language, a different energy, a different audience. all of which is actually quite upsetting to many people in the climate space who find it quite triggering, ethically unsound, vulgar, untrue. as well, which is an interesting one. And this I perceive is like an interesting shift of in understanding the post-truth. I mean that progressives tend to understand post-truth as lies. or alternative facts. I don't see it that way, I see it more as the spirit of the truth rather than the letter of the truth. So Our Fair Future is very much about the spirit of the truth. And it plays a bit fast and loose with the facts, but that there's a lot of interpretation and subjectivity in that. 

Speaker 2
And also it is ultimately political communications, right? 

Speaker 1
So it needs to be sufficiently rugged that it can withstand the rough and tumble of electoral politics. the truth in a technical sense often doesn't stand up to that. So that's kind of like the background. Our Fair Future in the Public Domain has been here now, just it's it's brand new, it's been there for about a month. There's a maybe Five five people, five of us who have publicly got our names connected with it. There's maybe a group of another dozen. Pardon? Do you say it's been out there for about a month? Yeah. Yeah. Um maybe about another dozen people, kind of like an outer circle, who are interested in its success, but don't feel comfortable putting their name publicly to it, so they're kind of chipping in with ideas, guidance and so forth. So we're really in a testing phase. Did you get a chance to read the slides? Yeah. Okay. So everything's up for negotiation. I have a vision for it, but I don't need it to be that vision. The only thing that I need is for something that works, that broadly takes us in the direction. So we're testing various styles of content. We've got the Rage Bailey content, which is probably about two-thirds. We've got more constructive content. which is largely covered by a syndication agreement that we've got with Matt Golding in his antidote videos. The Rage Bay content gets much better viewership, although the viewership is still very embryonic because of course we we haven't really started yet. Um I'm only really using Reddit at the moment because it's quite easy to get in front of other people on Reddit as opposed to other social medias where you need followers. So we're in an experimental phase. We are in desperate need of people to do social media. Once we've done a little bit of the testing, sees what sees what works, probably try and establish some kind of modest engagement metric. That will then be dropped into some funding applications, which I might not even start this year, probably the beginning of next year um to try and get some money 'cause there's no money at the moment. It's all being done on you know, on goodwill. Um so the immediate stuff is social media um capacity, then turning to funding and then quite short term as well is about leadership. Because as you saw in that three part theory of change of turn on team up and take over looking while takeover is sequence third, it's so big that it requires the ball starting to roll now And we need to figure out who the leadership of this movement would be. It's not me, I'm not the right demographic to do it. But there is a there's some genuine answer to this and a strategic answer to this. So the genuine answer to this is really about representation. and we don't need any more middle-aged white guys telling people what to do. 

Speaker 2
And the left has actually been incredibly bad relative even to the right in terms of Representing other people, it was just shocking. 

Speaker 1
So that's actually like the correct answer. The strategic answer is that, you know, our fair future is quite authoritarian at heart. It's going to come with a hard edge. And I think having a woman at the front would and miss you know, redirect some of the obvious criticism of toxic masculinity. maleness that comes with these you know and I think you know for instance if you look at the not that I'm suggesting that RFA future is a right-wing phenomenon, it is not. But if you look at somebody like Le Pen in France or Maloney in Germany or the woman whose name escapes me in the AFD, I'm sorry, Maloney in Italy, and the woman who escapes me who's even a lesbian. I think that's strategically pretty canny, in as much as it just kind of uh allows for a little bit more wiggle room and goodwill that they might not otherwise have received. And there's a certain amount of Thatcher-esque Comfort. Yeah, yeah. So that's in a nutshell where we're at. I could talk for hours, but that's like the starting point. 

Speaker 3
Um cool. Um So, me, um, where I'm coming at this from, um, I've Basically, forever. It's been very obvious to me for a long time that before I die, the world needs to change quite dramatically. That our incumbent systems are not in any way fit for the future. And That's true of everything from pensions, obviously not going to work in the age of changing demographics. I remember having that thought when I was about nine, driving to school. And listening to the radio and having a conversation with my dad, and it was like, This is that's our, you know, and through to obviously climate, we've got to entirely refactor everything. And all coming down to money, time, politics, energy and the incentives behind all of them and how we how we are structuring the game of the economy. We've gone from we've got this sort of extractive model in, it needs to become regenerative. I think there are sort of various growth and post-growth type of rabbit holes that we could go down as well. But I've been about trying to find various leverage points within the system where I could affect change. And the I'm also not going to explain this in a particularly coherent way because this is a this is a world that I went into quite deeply in sort of twenty fourteen through eighteen and then have sort of recovered from and been burned by and and had a lot of uh um Negative financial implications on my life since then and I went a bit too late on an idea that the Book um and so Again, being a function of demographic and era in which I was born, I've had basically built a career in technology. and using technology to try and change the world. And so exponential technology, existential threats, what can we do about them? Cool, let's design them out, let's mitigate them, let's try and change it. Hence in power being here and trying to use carbon markets to, you know Because, yeah, it's morally repugnant, but it's also the best game in town. And it helps upskill a whole bunch of people and processes until we can work out how to do it sensibly. sort of stuff. But previously, and the that's actually better, previously the sort of big thing I did was I set up something called represent. which was digital democracy, civic tech, and kind of an open version of YouGov. And so same it's like sort of Tinder in a way, right? So Do you think that vote should hit 16? Do you think that abortion should be free? Do you think that abortion should be? Do you think that NHS should be free? Do you think that You know, companies should have a right to exist. Do you think that would you like more cycle lanes where you live? Do you own your own house? And so you get this quantitative and qualitative and intentional and behavioral data sets building up around everybody. People were answering like fifty questions a day repeatedly. We had twenty thousand users. And By building up that data set, you can then not only go to the representatives and go, here's what your constituents think, but you also end up with a cohort of the willing who want to do something about something. And so, you know, hey, Lewisham, I've got 700 people right here who want who own their own house, who want to buy an electric car or join an electric car club but can't because there are no charging points and there are no this and that right, you know, enter a zip car or whichever car club du jour is. here are 700 people, run your experiment here, that's your spearhead and this is where you can scale it. And so taking creating creat taking Surfacing civic contention away from the ballot box and away from the cash the till and being able to find out what people actually want, where they do want to go, and then finding more experimental, engaging ways of helping people get there. And the key reason I did that is not just because it was obvious that something like Brexit was brewing and that this discontent and it was sort of you know, there are enough dead canaries to know that something was wrong in politics and this bifurcation that we've seen continue for the last well at least the last twelve years has was starting but and the polarization was starting but um because I'm relentlessly frustrated by the belief that narrative can change everything. And then it's sufficient to change culture, to change outcomes. I think it's true if there's the I forget what it's called. There's a better word for this, but it's basically the bullshit asymmetry principle. And it's a lot, you know, that a liar can put its boots on and can get around the world with all the truth that's got its boots on. And. That it takes a very little amount of narrative to destroy something, but it takes an awful lot of doing to build it up and restore it or preserve it. maintain it. And I think we as a culture, as a society, have sort of forgotten that. And that there is a Craving for greater levels of action and engagement and civic. Wow, I'm expecting this badly. 

Speaker 2
I'm getting it, it's alright. 

Speaker 3
And because I'm sort of jumping around between me and thesis. Okay, back to me. I've used technology. for the last twenty-five years to do various things like working for the police, to do communication systems so that they can better mitigate the effects of terrorism, creating 

Speaker 4
coordination systems in the event of emergencies for the government, risk analysis for insurance industries, working out where in the world is dangerous, wife, to who set up a then a thing called Food Trade, which was mapping the food system. to relocalize and shorten supply chains. Hang on, can you just give me a sec? Um uh uh so um 

Speaker 5
Yeah, and then and then so did food trade sort of like okay, so how do we how do we how do we build in resilience to our systems? 

Speaker 3
How do we create Ways of changing the system and food is a really great place to push, or agri-food actually is a really great place to push because It's fresh water, it's health, it's employment, it's localism, it's culture, it's you know, there's there's an awful lot of good c positive cascades and skill sets and future careers and pride and so on that comes from food production. It's very, very purposeful and fulfilling. Um but the economics of it is entirely screwed. And so that one um was ambitious but yeah. ultimately didn't work. Um then moved into uh doing represent which was digital Civic tech and a little bit of liquid democracy, and you know, liquid democracy. It's cool, you're my representative. But I disagree with you on climate policy. Whereas I agree with you on climate policy. 

Speaker 2
Who do you agree with? 

Speaker 3
And so. Everything, you can have my vote for everything, my local MP, but generally I want to follow what you say about climate. And so everything tagged climate that comes through the system. Do you think there's about this new tunnel or HS2 or this or whatever? I get I you I copy your vote by default. Basically, I'm giving you my vote. And then if you want to give it to someone else who you trust for climate policy and so on and so on. So you go from the incumbent system of one person, forty thousand constituent, to um how many constit what's the ratio of constituents to MPs? No idea. I shouldn't know that one, shouldn't I? What is the representation concentration? 

Speaker 1
Probably not important for this. 

Speaker 3
Point, not important, but you go from that to a far more granular, topic-based, trust-based system. And so it's about Essentially reconfiguring power flows through the system, right? Which is the same sort of thing that you were talking about, but it's doing it with mission, with trust, with engagement. Because as soon as you realise that, you know, like, oh, my voice does actually count, I'm going to go a little bit deeper and be a little bit more important on this, hopefully, and be a little bit more rigorous about some of my decisions and thoughts on this. And there's a role for me here as a responsible climate representative in my area. And so, yeah, that was a sort of goal of represent to both improve the existing system With more data, but then also give it a pathway to a future system that was more capable of more granular, localized, experimental Change on the ground. Brexit happened, everyone decided they didn't give a shit what anyone else thought about voting, and democracy was a bad idea. And so parked that and basically tried to keep it alive for a while and ran out of cash and spent lots of money and got very frustrated and depressed. And then but carried on doing little bits of consulting here and there. you know, did some did some stuff, um some shorter and longer term contracts and then ended up here because thought, well, essentially I had a child and needed a steady income. I have often thought that we need a union of humanity. Like, essentially, it's all of this stuff doesn't count unless you can have power, unless you can have some kind of teeth. And system assemblies, like people go on about the system assemblies as if there's some kind of salvation in I don't know. System assemblies are the bone that you get tossed when the elite choose to allow you, you know, say we want a different outcome that structurally we've we've painted ourselves into a corner on. I mean this might be the moment when I put in my my little quick yeah sorry I'm gonna lost stop. No no no um it's just 

Speaker 1
Just just not a sculpt for it, just a uh an interjection. The the the way the the difference I highlight between climate activism and climate populism is that climate activism seeks to influence power and climate populism seeks to take 

Speaker 2
That's it. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Right, and that is where we, you know, coming back to that three-part theory of change of turn-on, team-up, take over. A lot of what you're talking about is kind of in the mindset of the team up. part of the theory of change which has yet is completely not figured out, you know, all honesty. The mechanics of it are completely missing. You know, some people like assemblies, um for all the reasons that you're talking about, it's I I I don't. Um but sequenced, m maybe it's enough in sequence With that, take over part three. And here I might just kind of articulate a couple of pathways about what that might look like. In the deck it's described with some strategic ambiguity as become an electoral force. 

Speaker 2
Now there's a couple of ways that I could see this. 

Speaker 1
So right now, for example, we've already mentioned Zach Bolanski, who's running for the Green Party on this eco-populism platform, is bollocks. I can't see it working. 

Speaker 3
But let's say for example can I just pause for a sec. Are you saying that like you wrote an article in response to climate majority, which I've not 

Speaker 2
read either of them actually. 

Speaker 3
I saw someone else responding, writing it a sort of takedown piece of it as well, so I'm not defending them. But are you We can park this bit. But on the one hand, it seems that you're calling for a sort of semi-broad church, like, doesn't fucking matter to deal with the people that you don't like. And move forward. And on the other hand, you're obviously saying that's bollocks, so yeah, it's not. So let me tell you why. 

Speaker 1
This is not some people's friend of Judea thing. Yeah, so it's quite fundamental. And there's different reasons. So Rupert and Caroline at the CMP are not actually talking about climate populism at all. 

Speaker 2
This is actually a big error. 

Speaker 1
They're talking that they shifted this word popularism. So what they're actually talking about is our popular centrist politics, which is completely misses the political zeitgeist 

Speaker 2
What you need is a green reform ultimately. 

Speaker 1
So, they're talking about centuries politics. They're doing it in an upper-middle class kind of elitist way. They're trying to co-opt a little bit of populist energy, but failing miserably. So that's why that's bullshit. Zach's is a little bit different. He is actually trying to lean in to something that is genuinely similar similar to proper populism, but he doesn't actually have Any authenticity. You know, he's a, and there's nothing wrong with this, but he's a gay man who lives with his boyfriend on a boat in East London. He's an ex-drama student who used to do community theatre. And had a a previous career as a hypnotist, making women's tits bigger. 

Speaker 2
He's a political entrepreneur, which is going to go used to be for Liberal Democrats. 

Speaker 1
So it's whatever is kind of working and he performs literally whatever he thinks is going to work. But it looks like a performance and there's no way that he's going to be able to pull off. you know, going down to a a pub in Hull and having a conversation with a regular person. He's just going to look like a fucking idiot. So that's not going to work either. So that's why I'm dismissing those things. 

Speaker 3
It's not people shrunk in Judea and I've kind of 

Speaker 1
And let me explain my problem. 

Speaker 3
Sure. Yeah, I didn't want to get we can pug that entirely. 

Speaker 1
So let let but let's say for example that I'm wrong, which I'd be happy to be wrong. 

Speaker 2
actually, about Zach. 

Speaker 1
He pulls it off and he go he takes the Green Party in 2029 elections from four to forty seats, for example. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
That would be fantastic. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
And I would be delighted to put our fair future at his disposal as a content machine, for example. Similarly, with the Corbin party that's starting up I can't imagine it working, it's like 1977 socialism, never going to happen. But if it did, similarly, great. So, why would I compete with somebody who's actually doing what I'm aspiring to do? I can't see any of that working. So here's what becoming an electoral force actually looks like to me. I would anticipate incorporating our fair future as a political party in 2017. Having a very minor dry run in the 29 election just to fail and learn from some early mistakes. I anticipate Farage winning in 29 and the silver lining to all about polluting dark money that puts me in place is that it breaks open this space of the two party system In the minds of the British electoral, which means that new entrants are suddenly, the door is open to new entrants. Obviously, you know, Farage has a dumpster fire, he fucks up spectacularly, Conservatives are already dead, Labour can't keep up, so does it From 29 to 34, that I see as a really serious scaling and political run period with the ambition of a super serious 

Speaker 2
run for the 2034 election and winning it. 

Speaker 1
And at that point, you come in with a Trump-like flood the zone. So we've now got nine years to create a transition plan. So that on day one of being in office on 2034, there is this tsunami of climate nature equality policies That the opposition just cannot keep up with. No one knows what's going on. This is the beauty of what Trump has demonstrated, and actually Hitler, to be honest, did exactly the same thing. same thing. If you haven't read Hitler's first 100 days, the book on what happened when he got into power, you should do because it's an amazing playbook. And this is where it's really important to unpack like structure from content when it comes to these bad guys. Because structurally, they've got really insightful strategies on how to implement power. It's just that the content of their policies are catastrophic and genocidal. So that's kind of where I see it going, which is why I kind of bring up this idea of leadership. Because there's you'd really need to get, you'd want at least five people to run in 29. 

Speaker 2
That's going to come real quick. 

Speaker 1
When I had this conversation, I'd start talking about 2034. I see people phasing out, thinking it's too long. 

Speaker 2
And thinking look, I've kind of chosen to engineer what needs to be done. And that's tight. That's a tight timeframe. 

Speaker 1
So that's right. So, and I guess my point being. taking power, for example that's absolutely the like the point. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Um and the responses that I tend to get to that um I'm gonna say one-third of people dismiss it as totally battish shittery. And they point to failed new entrants in the past, of course, but we're in a new phase. The fact that something has no precedent is meaningless. We are in an unprecedented phase. We've got a historically unprecedented problem in the climate and nature crises that will require an historically unprecedented 

Speaker 2
That's an actual symmetry, in my mind. 

Speaker 1
So you've got one-third of people saying, talk about shittery, forget about it. But they're still actually quite interested in talking about. the alternative methods of becoming an electoral force. But then the other two-thirds, what typically happens is you kind of get this quick raise of the eyebrows at how nutty it sounds, but then they start thinking. Because those people know that all of the theories of change that they've been working on have failed. They know that business can't move the needle. 

Speaker 2
They know that civic society is totally irrelevant. 

Speaker 1
They know that governments cannot be influenced and that incremental change is dead. They know that the clock is ticking and unless we course correct within know 10 to 15 years we're all doomed. So then they see this moment of okay 20 when becoming prime minister at 2034 initially sounds batshit crazy 

Speaker 2
But it is intellectually honest and actually, if you could do it, would make a change. 

Speaker 1
And any intellectually honest person knows that there's actually no other way of doing that right now. So then I've actually been quite surprised how quickly people can get in the headspace of that. The challenge then becomes how you deliver on it, what is required. And here is where climate progressives start getting a bit wobbly. I take the whole Malcolm X by Any Means Necessary provocation quite seriously. I am willing to do whatever it takes to get into power in 2034. 

Speaker 2
And I say I, not like I'm not going to be the Prime Minister. Yeah, it's in there. This is not about me building a platform for myself in any way. I don't want to be at the front of the world. Yeah, you know. 

Speaker 1
So and I do that because and this isn't in a completely rational thing, right? We are we're doomed on our current pathway. So we've we've only got we can the only choice that we have is to choose between different types of scary. We can choose between the scary of the status quo, which is going to run us off the diff. or we can choose between the scary of doing what is necessary to course correct. And I actually genuinely, rationally believe that the scariness of course correction is less scary 

Speaker 2
than the scariness of the status quo. 

Speaker 1
So that involves getting it's wet work, it's dirty hands, getting into the rough and tumble of what the political zeitgeist is. It's gnarly, it's full of bullshit, it's performative, it is manipulative and dark. That's the way it is. If you're not willing to get into that, you will fail. And this is like the negotiation I find myself in with people who kind of. like like the ends, but are worried about the means. So but this is just the reality of it. If you're not willing to understand what that the means to reach that ends, then Well, you've actually opted out, and that's actually morally quite repugnant. So that's like the real bare, you know, raw approach to it. It's taking power. Doing whatever it takes to take power. But obviously, there is so much, and you know, and there's a bunch of other stuff that people don't like. 

Speaker 2
I'm giving you all of the behind-the-scenes nasty stuff. We're not nasty, but we've got this phrase of strategic ambiguity. So in order to appeal to those Daily Mail reform voters, you will never hear about climate racial justice. 

Speaker 1
You're never going to hear us advocating for trans rights. You're never going to hear us calling somebody a racist or far right. that that all's gone. Now there is that doesn't mean that diversity is gone, but within the core group. There's two middle-aged white guys, a white female millennial, a black female Gen Z person and a millennial male Muslim guy. It's show, don't tell. 

Speaker 2
We are there. 

Speaker 1
And in fact, if you're going to have the 99% versus the enemy who are the polluters, that requires diversity in a way that totally blows 

Speaker 2
the lid off anything the progressives are talking about, because you've got to sit down and have conversations with nasty people. 'Cause that's what the ninety nine percent demands. 

Speaker 1
And I I know what that's like. I mean, I had an i a conversation with some uh a well known populist group who you would absolutely recognise, who you might be surprised to know are developing kind of a climate policy. And in this broader group was a well-known public figure who is a won't be around the bush a nasty, racist, right-wing person. Um and that caused me a lot of anxiety even being Even for there to be a paper chain between me and this guy. 

Speaker 2
But that's what's required in the 99%, right? So but you've got to accept it. 

Speaker 3
I want did a sort of co-presentation debate thing. It wasn't co-presentation. We were both on the on the same session talking about ideas and and then had a panel afterwards with George Galloway. And I think The number of people who thought that was a really bad idea and republican, like That's democracy. That's like, of course, people are going to have ideas that we know. You can't just disengage with it. Yeah, I find it quite astonishing that people are. You do need to go there. You do need to engage people and acknowledge where they're coming from. 

Speaker 1
That's an interesting person to talk about. I mean, I would see some kind of Actually, I don't have any problems with George Galloway. I mean, obviously, he's a raging narcissist. Actually, politically, I've got Very few objections to George Galloway, but I think he's actually the kind of person that you'd probably want fronting this kind of movement, not a male boomer. but that kind of total belief and that his or her way is the right way forward Complete rejection of the system. It's a vibe, and that whole vibe, I think, is the vibe and the energy. 

Speaker 3
Have you how how battle tested is this theory? Because uh have you have you gone out and spoken with essentially lots of because I think When Netflix came out, it was very reassured by How the I've always had this craving for essentially better quality programming And I've always believed that people did other people wanted it as well. Other people wanted good documentaries and longer form programming and like long podcast On an issue and deep dives, right? And if you look at the popularity of long-form deep dive podcasts, there is a craving for more than ITV two and Mike McIntyre. And you've got and I think there the sort of the Daily Mail, yeah, there's a comfort zone of being served rage bait and and you know, something that's titling and you can feel better than, and that's always very reassuring if you find yourself you know, d disadvantaged and frustrated that finding someone else that you can feel superior to in various ways. That's very satisfying. You know, that's a nice dope for me and click. But in terms of There is also an appetite for growth, for construction, etc. etc. And And what how are you how are you balancing those two appetites? 

Speaker 1
So th this is where the three-part theory of change comes in, because it works like a funnel. So that whole turn-on phase that we're in at the moment is the the broad end of the funnel. People were coming in mostly for the rage bait. Sequenced, then down into team up. 

Speaker 2
That's where the type of more constructive Rich community relationships stuff comes into place, and they've already been honest and don't have the mechanics of that yet. 

Speaker 1
So I think we give both. Whether or not things are tested, no, not at all. I mean, we've we've managed to piggyback on some polling. I mean, I know how people perceive the R Fair Future name. I don't know how people perceive like the the top level messaging around it, and that seems to be okay. And there's a slide on that and a deck. But beyond that, who knows? This you know, this is based on my basically my intuitive read and that intuition is Yes, it's feelings, it's reading the tea leaves, but it's also based on what is now a lifetime of Looking at what's going on. You know, I've been political kind of my whole life. You know, I got arrested on national TV at the age of 14 at the poll tax riots in Southampton with my school uniform on. and have felt there was something profoundly wrong with the left my whole. 

Speaker 2
Life, which is why I've actually never really got into it in any serious way, because it just felt out of step with what's needed. 

Speaker 1
For the past 15 years, I've spent more of my time not on the right, don't want to give that impression at all, but certainly reading the right. So the right-wingers have got a much better understanding structurally of what's happening in the world right now and what works. So I've actually taken a lot of kind of right-wing political theory and my aspiration is to redeem that political theory and to deploy it for good. And I don't talk about that externally, but I try and bring that up internally a lot with people, pushing people to the types of writers who have influenced my thinking. Behind our fair future are all right wing. So yeah, it's intuition, but it's informed intuition. 

Speaker 4
But it's not tested in any serious way. That's what this group period is about, really. 

Speaker 1
I mean, if we go through I don't know, a year, and absolutely zero traction is achieved, then maybe I'm proved wrong. I'm not necessarily proved wrong, it could be that I just didn't deploy it properly. And that's where I need a lot of help. And there's quite a reasonable amount of goodwill at the moment. And I've actually been surprised how swiftly the conversation has changed this year alone. How much easier it is to have these conversations now than this time last year. It's actually quite stunning. But it absolutely could fail because of my lack of skills. And this is where I'm trying very seriously now to Get get establish more ownership. Like, come in. Take over the bits that you don't see that I'm flailing around with, and I've got no fucking idea what I'm talking about. I'm trying to give stuff away. That's quite challenging because people, you know. Aren't used to taking ownership, they don't have the confidence to do it. Those people that probably do have the confidence to do it 

Speaker 2
might want to redirect it in directions which I'm not comfortable with, but I'd be open to having those conversations. 

Speaker 1
So but yeah, I've got certain skill sets. My skill sets are ideas, long-term vision, I'm pretty good at. energizing people in one on one conversations I'm quite good at. Embodying a kind of that naughty populist energy I'm quite good at. But I've got And I've noticed from all of the failures I've had in the past, I cannot scale initiatives. Fucking useful to it. And I can't raise money and I can't build movements which I guess are scaling initiatives. 

Speaker 2
But in the past, it's a bit different. Yeah. 

Speaker 1
But yeah, you s you get the idea. Um so that that's really and I'm I'm trying to be completely transparent about that and asking people, anybody who's interested to plug in if they're finding it compelling because I've been looking around really hard for the past couple of years. and are reasonably well connected in the climate space, both on the corporate and the activist side. And I cannot see any compelling idea in development right now that it's going in the right direction. Which is why I've ended up having to do this. 

Speaker 2
I'd rather not be doing it. 

Speaker 1
But if someone else was if I happened to bump into someone else who's further advanced I'd be happy to to support it. 

Speaker 3
It's really weird, isn't it? Do you want to walk off it? 

Speaker 1
No, we're good. 

Speaker 3
Um do you mind walking in? Yeah. Um uh the um the 

Speaker 1
They're talking about unique segments in our shops that they don't do anything about and that they're not going to be able to do it. I will construct any people that do it. So it's quite a clear where is the Do you have to kind of make it to the time you have the experiment? Yeah, yeah. So it it's actually been quite shocking. Um I I resisted starting Going starting something from scratch, because I I know of my historical failures of not being able to skip them. Um but God I looked hard and I couldn't find anything and I'm still not finding anything. And I'm asking people who are, particularly in the activist scene, who are even more connected than me, and like sort of conversations with like family specs are and things like this. Nothing is happening. It's just conversations, dinner parties, shit like this. 

Speaker 3
Similarly, I've actually reached out to a bunch of people recently and sort of having that same sort of cover that that's the exact same question. Do you know of anybody that's doing anything in this sort of essentially the counterfarage space? Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Are we all just doing yoga or something? They are locally. 

Speaker 3
Yeah, what's happening? Yeah, and it's that it's that sort of the soma of yoga versus the I don't know, I need to To workshop that analogy. But no, it's the making of the palliative care of the left and progressive. 

Speaker 1
I've got to invite you down to this one. Populism discussion, but it was not interesting. 

Speaker 2
Brian Eno's place. 

Speaker 1
It was all about the great and the good of the cultural and artistic. 

Speaker 2
You know, elite of London. Yeah. Some people from NGOs, hopefully about hate, stuff like that, talking about this. So again, they were all making 

Speaker 1
They were all making the right analysis and all reaching the right conclusions from their analysis. It was actually quite sophisticated to the point where we've got to stop calling everybody fascists, etc. Yeah, absolutely. 

Speaker 2
Well done that took a decade. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, but that's actually much more sophisticated than most progressives who are still stuck in that mode. But yeah, no discussion about You know, I hope not hate you're doing a little bit of difference in as much as you know they've got some you know they'll do community initiatives like in a block of flats or something, which I completely endorse, but nothing like at the national level. It's quite stunning. And that, I think, is why there's as much goodwill behind Our Fair Future as there is. Why somebody essentially I'm a nobody, I mean, I'm actually also quite new to the climate space, just a few years. You know, I've had many twists and turns in my career. As to why somebody who's new to the space and who doesn't really have that much of a personal brand has managed to capture the imagination of a kind of a a reasonable core of people in the inner circle. I don't think that's because of there's anything particularly spectacular about the concept. It's merely the next step to actually deploying it. And because no one else has done that, yep, people are latching on to this, which is great. Yeah. 

Speaker 3
So, okay, so there's the political thread. I'm uh ag again, I'm I'm sort of out of practice communicating a lot of this stuff and thinking about a lot of this stuff. Um The what I'm wondering is There's the the political threat and the you know the 2029-34 path right and the power I often wondered with the Labour Party whilst they were you know spent their 15 years in in opposition. You think trains should be nationalised and you think you can run a better train service? Well, they're there for the take it. Take one, buy it, turn it into a cooperative, raise it, make it work. Improve it and deliver on your ideas rather than just pontificating about them. And how can you deliver on the ideas rather than just pontificating about them? them. So hope not hate's working in flats. What's the lean startup methodology? What how do you prove that these things work and what can you do? And and other examples of this. Al-Qaeda and what's the other one? ISIS. set up schools, set up food delivery programmes, set up health care. Like they go into they are the the poppies and the nettles of disruption. When there is a scorched earth after whatever chaos, they come in and they provide structure and order. And then they take their pound of flesh on it. Same as the mafia, right? There's disorder and corruption over here, or there's order and corruption over here. Which do you want? 

Speaker 1
So, the space for that is in the team-up part of the three-part theory of change, which I've already kind of suggested. 

Speaker 2
And what does it look like? 

Speaker 1
The mechanics are missing. So, there's a couple of different ways of looking at this. A good example of reform would be, you know, Farage got a bunch of sticks for this, but earlier this year he launched this kind of partnership with the retail platform. where they bought, for example, nappies in bulk and would sell them on to reform supporters at the cost at their bulk cost a day, which is Good. 

Speaker 3
Brilliant. 

Speaker 1
Now, you know, the progressives tried to belittle and debunk that as some kind of business scam on his part. good stuff. Yeah. 

Speaker 2
Yes. 

Speaker 1
So that would be the kind of thing that you'd be looking at. So there's a couple of ways that the initial thinking was our Fair Future needs to build its own branded team up structure. and the details of that work continue to be very hard to imagine what that looks like. The thinking at the moment is moving more towards a partnership model So you've got, there are initiatives all around the country that are doing tiny little things. 

Speaker 2
You know, a cooperation hole that we had the video about with an Our Fair Future last week. 

Speaker 1
For example, or you know, people who are doing initiatives in churches, people who are doing initiatives in football clubs or whatever is I think probably it's a partnership model where our Fair Future functions as a kind of like a a connective tissue, like there's like a a conceptual and ideological connective tissue between existing types of things where we start getting where the branding starts really co-opting. other methods of teaming up and people can kind of can kind of identify, all right, there's an Our Fair Future vibe to that initiative. And this is where I think the broad church of the thinking is quite important. And a good conversation that we had with, that I had with the antidote, these constructive videos. We got. We were sat down there and we kind of figured out: all right, I think we've got about 80% where we're in alignment. 15% where it's kind of ambiguous, and 5% where we're really quite disconnected. And we decided that's absolutely good enough. We don't need 100% alignment. And I think progressives and again, people surrounded Judea are pretty bad at that. So I think if we can kind of get that 80%, if there's 80% alignment. And that misalignment could actually incorporate some really big things like differences of opinion on migrants or trans rights. It's in the 20%. 

Speaker 2
That's okay. We've got 80% alignment. 

Speaker 1
So I think it's going to be in partnerships. So this is another big kind of like along with the funding and the leadership, I think partnerships in order to start fleshing out that team up part theory of change. 

Speaker 2
is another big lift that needs to happen, probably starting next year. 

Speaker 1
Because we're really just thinking and testing and through doing at the moment. So yes, it needs to happen. What it looks like, I don't really know. One or two people in the core group have said they're going to start thinking more about this yet. I haven't really seen anything from that, but it's absolutely the right question. 

Speaker 3
What do you think about transition towns? Do you know about transition towns? 

Speaker 1
Yes, I know about transition towns. Yeah, it's a nice idea. It's a nice idea within that particular step of the sequence. 

Speaker 3
Do you know? Do you yeah, it's still sort of limping on. Do you know where it from its sort of heyday about 15 years ago? Yeah. Okay, but. 

Speaker 1
Because it you know, ultimately it's about taking power. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Alright, so I see I see that as an example of some of it of like the team up dynamic, but it's not enough. And that's where that three-part theory of change sequenced, but also in parallel. I think is really important because whether or not you're a somebody thinking that you've got to change the world through giving people better information, part one, or a transition talent, part two, they're not enough on their own. you've absolutely got to take power. And trying to get that sequencing in place, I think is really important. But I don't pretend to have the answers for that bit that part of the puzzle yet. I think 

Speaker 3
So do you think strategic yeah, how are you doing for time about that? 

Speaker 2
I should do it at nine. Okay. 

Speaker 3
What else would you like to get out of this conversation? Yeah. Yeah, I mean if if anything, other than like, hello, we've met. 

Speaker 1
Yeah, so I I'm always happy to to articulate things 'cause that helps me refine things. I'm always happy to hear the pushbacks and at the moment I have Felt any because it's like I feel that your thinking is very much and set you right, you're asking the right questions that I'm asking. But I'm always happy to hear pushbacks because I'm not pretending that this is all begged down. It's a testing faith, so I need critical friends. So that's all good. I'm always interested in I also need help. So my hope would be that You hear some compelling ideas, and that catalyzes some thoughts about who might be able to plug into them. I feel that I'm in a like a literally a like knocking on doors phase at the moment. 

Speaker 2
So I'm really enjoying his conversation. 

Speaker 1
because that's kind of all I can do until I get money that enables me to buy Google Ads and you know actually Get, you know, like customer acquisition comes at a cost, right? And I can't do that at the moment. So, all I can do is to have these kind of on conversations try and build trust and goodwill with people. This is a point that I forgot to make earlier on. So in the takeover phase In the leadership phase, I've already proposed that this is quite authoritarian at heart because we're going to be taking away people's freedoms to choose. and have already proposed that I'm willing to bend the rules, do whatever needs by any means necessary. Now all of that is horrifically open to abuse. Um and typically and actually my my kind of original background is in theology and religious studies. I've been work around kind of alternative spirituality. And stuff like this. And I've seen this happen, right? You get charismatic people come in, they get a bit of goodwill from people, they burn them and they abuse them, and it's. 

Speaker 3
a catastrophe. 

Speaker 1
So there is a lot of potential for this to go catastrophically wrong. So it needs accountability. There's a couple of things. First of all, it needs it's such a big ask of people to come in, not only do what is scary, but do what could go badly wrong that it requires demonstration of integrity. And this is where I think it's really important for me to be able to have conversations with people one-on-one because I hope that I can demonstrate a little bit of integrity. People can give me the benefit of the doubt so that when they're feeling a bit wally about what this implies, they can ground that back in the conversations. That we've had. So that's part one of the point. Part two is Having the people that feel that, who believe it, but then can also come in and hold that space with equal integrity and to hold other people with it accountable for it. So one of the things I'm kind of assuming with the leadership, you know, we need charismatic people who are slightly narcissistic to run the show, that's it's inevitable, but we need them held accountable. So you need people in there that kind of understand the need for it, but have also got what it takes to give those people a firm hand when it needs to be. So I'm trying right from the start to I've actually gone quite slowly. I've kind of never asked people to do specific things for me. I've waited, you know, I've opened up the I've invited general Involvement, but I've never asked people to do something. I want people to offer. And then I'm super conscious. about not burning people out, not overwhelming people, and that's me meant everything's going a bit slow at the moment. But I need that foundation in place. I mean we need a core group of people that trust one another, that know that there is actually care and intentionality at the heart of this because it it might look from the outside that different. It might look aggressive, it might look leery, but this is it is actually like a care-based phenomenon, right? That's what it it has to be because it's the only way that you can provide a compelling alternative to the oppression of the elites is to care for one another. So that's just like a little aside that I thought is worth making, is that there is a lot of potential for things to go wrong. And right now, I think it's worthwhile going a little bit slower to make sure that people are Feeling good. 

Speaker 3
Have you ever done a start? Do you know what I mean by the lean startup methodology? 

Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean, I've described this as an MVP movement. 

Speaker 3
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
That's the language I use in the deck. 

Speaker 3
Okay, cool. I think the so my my pushback, and I think the reason you're not getting a lot of pushback is because I'm I'm not confident that I'm right. I think there's I'm also very confident that you're largely right on a whole bunch of stuff. Like we do definitely agree. I'm not holding back my critiques. But I definitely have a set of experiments that I'd be interested to run to see how accurate some of those hypotheses are. and what other truths might be adjacent that are better. And I think in terms of product market fit 

Speaker 2
to continue to use the meth the terminology. 

Speaker 3
I think that's a really interesting point about that dissonance and the need to uh demonstrate integrity because some of it looks like it might be a little bit too fierce and that dissonance between those two things, I think that can be reconciled so that you don't have to defend yourself against that critique before scaling. I think have you ever read any um Hansie Freinacht, metamodernism stuff. There's now, it sounds really wanky, because like metamodernism and fries yet anotherism and Correctly, another sort of navel-gazing philosophical movement. And yes, it is. But there's a bunch of really interesting sort of observations and ideas and reflections in it. His approach to It's sort of part anonymous. Remember anonymous in that kind of, yeah, yeah, we're gonna go and we're gonna fuck you up. If we think you're doing something bad and wrong, we're gonna fuck you up and we're not gonna hold ourselves. Like, we're gonna hold oursel But we're going to hold you accountable as well. 

Speaker 1
But we're also going to play with it. So one quick point. There has been thinking behind this around the brand identity. So the idea of Our Fair Future as a name is that it is actually quite progressive and warm. And in the polling it shows that people who are progressive like it more than people on the right, although people on the right still are favourable. And then on the visual identity That's the difference between you know the full logo which has got you know the little asterisk and then if you saw on the on the deck the strike off So, in the strike-off, if you just slap me, imagine shh, that's it, right? You can imagine like thousands of people going around the nation. 

Speaker 2
If you don't like something, struck off. You don't want to do too much of this. Yeah, well, you know what I mean? 

Speaker 1
So the point is to be able to dial it up and dial it down. So in full, our Fair Future as a name with the full logo is quite comfortable. But the struck off symbol on its own is quite aggressive. And the idea is to yeah, but depending on on where you are in the movement, in the beginning, maybe you can afford more militancy as you go towards get power, you need to be a safer pair of hands. So depending about where you are in the movement and who you're talking to, given that you want both just up oil people and daily mail people. That you can dial up or down depending on circumstance. That was the idea at least that kind of not necessarily addresses, but is in the same space as the point you're making. 

Speaker 3
I think I think I get what you're saying that But I think within the core I think the the core of the movement and the representatives of the movement Need to have a yes, you can come at this angry, you can come at this. um pissed off, you can come at this enlightened, you can come at this point, you know, from from all s from a from a fairness and injustice angle, you can come at this from all sorts of angles. But I think at the core I was trying to r uh think of some of the people I was have you come across a guy called Simon Squibb or actually like yeah, the the sorts lots of the sort of working class dragon den dragon's den type You know, the the the Alan Sugars even the Donald Trumps, right? You know, he was he was the apprentice and that Drafting, not grifting. We work hard and we earn it, and that And a sense of pride, and um but then also Jimmy Carr Have you seen any of Jimmy Carr's latest stuff? He's sort of blending into taking Stephen Fry's position over quick helmet philosopher. 

Speaker 1
20 of well 20 23 of the past 25 years outside of the UK yeah and there's a lot of cultural references that I don't get 

Speaker 3
And so the this like the sort of Jimmy Carr, he's got you know he's he's got very crass humour not crass humour at times, like he's he's smart, but he'll he'll be very rude and lewd and you know say things that you you will laugh at but also You would never try and make that joke yourself. No but there are quite there are quite a few of the sort of more right-wing comedians who do the same sort of thing, but within them is a kindness. and a compassion and an acceptance of you know and it's that that and that's what that's the mesomomalism thing right of like we recognize it's all We're here, we're just trying to muddle through. But also, we've got to stand for something. And if you don't stand for something, then that sort of shit happens. You know? And I think I f I find this hard to p put pin down and put into words, but that way of sort of stoking capturing through abrasion, frustration, and but then landing in pragmatism and And essentially, some sort of progress. It's yes, it's anti, but it's anti-through obsolescence, not anti-through Bothering to fight them. It's anti-through fucking off and playing a different game and then just making this one obsolete. It's anti-through adoption of you know different currencies and local like you know it's not about nationalism it's about localism it's about you know cha changing on your doorstep it's about taking pride in our neighbourhoods etc And making sure that it works at the human scale, not just the ideological scale. I'm gonna have to wrap it up because I've really got you going. 

Speaker 1
Absolutely. 

Speaker 2
I think we'll settle into the nuanced 

Speaker 1
Position over time. But I also think there will be a diversity of positions. And that's also probably going to be necessary. You know, ultimately, I almost like to lose control of it. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker 1
Where there's all sorts of, you know, if it's going to be the 99%, there are going to be all of these different types of our fair future vernacular. that are starting to unfold that can actually sound quite different, almost opposed to one another, but that's the nature of diversity in the 99%. 

Speaker 2
I could talk all day about this, but I need to go and get all the stuff. 

Speaker 1
This was a great first conversation. Yeah. Um hopefully we can pick it up somewhere along the line and have a think about whether or not it 

Speaker 3
you know useful yeah i will write that about it but do you need the chat for you no i won't be
